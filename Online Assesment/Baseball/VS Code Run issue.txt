vs code is acting weird.

when u run the code, even if everything is correct synthatically it gives "NameError: name 'baseball_scorekeeping' is not defined" for about 30 seconds 

after approx 30 seconds, if u run again it runs as expected.

even tried clear editor history, didnt work


its making prorgamming like philosophy :-(
